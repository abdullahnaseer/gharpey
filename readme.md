## About GharPey

There are a huge number of hardworking women in Pakistan who work at home or any workplace making products that they are unable to display and sell on some huge audience platform. Similarly, talented women lack opportunities to deliver local services like Bridal Makeup etc. Whether it is a doorstep service or the service they provide from home/workplace, the issue continues in either way. The proposed system aimed at helping those hardworking talented women by offering a platform to sell their products and services at much lower cost and with less understanding. 

The proposed system will allow and encourage the Pakistani women to use digital marketplace and showcase their skills and talent in well-secured manner through this platform. This platform will allow seller to create a shop as her brand, add products on it and sell them. Besides products, sellers can also provide system-defined services that could be either the doorstep service or the home / workplace service they provide Sellers can manage their store portfolios and maintain reputation through buyer reviews to survive the digital market platform. Sellers can keep track of all orders and payments and enjoy popular payment methods.
